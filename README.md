Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)

All about sorting algorithms
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

0. Bubble sort
mandator

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

1. Insertion sort
mandatory

Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

2. Selection sort
mandatory

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

3. Quick sort
mandatory

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
